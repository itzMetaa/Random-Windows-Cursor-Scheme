# Random-Windows-Cursor-Scheme
This small project aims to shuffle between your favourite cursor schemes on each startup.

1. Get a cursor of your choice.

2. When you run (double click to open) program.cmd the mouse options will pop up, chose your desired scheme to save. 

3. Press 1 and enter on the terminal to save the currently selected cursor scheme.

3.1 (Optional) Keep the mouse tab open so you can quickly save your favourite cursor schemes.

3.2 (optional) As soon as you're done, you can press 2 and enter to roll for a scheme from your saved ones.

4. IF you'd like to have a random cursor on each start-up, press 3 and enter.

5. (Extra info) Since Windows 11, there needs to be a minimal cpu% usage for windows to start opening programs automatically, so it might take a couple of seconds.
